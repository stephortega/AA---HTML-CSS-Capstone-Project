# AA---HTML-CSS-Capstone-Project
HTML & CSS Capston Project in App Academy.
**Requirements**
You can use the topic, theme, or purpose of your choosing for this project. Make a profile site, fan page for your favorite band, team, or show, a site all about your cat - whatever you want to show off to your friends and family!

Because you'll be putting it on the internet for the world to see, you'll want to pick a topic your comfortable sharing. However, you don't need to worry about a future employer judging you for your code here. Hiring managers absolutely love seeing measures of growth, development, and experimentation in your online profile.

At a minimum, your site must have the elements and features listed below.

You can add to this if you'd like, but you're usually better off starting small and expanding after you have completed the first set of tasks. It's much better to make a small site that is complete than succumb to feature creep and end up with a large site that is unfinished.
